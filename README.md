## Background

In stock market, investor often look for digital tool to collect and analyse the financial data. To facilitate a better trading decision making process, an application could be developed so that it could predict future share price of a stock and help on making trading decisions.
Machine learning models could be used and back testing could be conducted to evaluate the performance of the output application. In the future, the blockchain technology could be used in this project in the second semester.

##Problem Statement
In trading stocks shares, normally some indicators based on statistics such as SMA and JDK are used by most of the investors along with their personal perception on news and political information. However, most of those indicators are based on simple algorithm, and the trading decisions generated are often too rigid, thus the estimation rate of return is not satisfying.
This project proposes using machine learning to replace the traditional indicators and try to predict the future states of stock market. Both traditional features of stock shares could be extracted and trading decision is supposed to benefit from the prediction.
